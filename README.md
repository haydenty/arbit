Arbit is a Node.js application that was created to arbitrage crypto currency exchanges. The idea being that you could buy a coin on Exchange X for a lower price and then sell on Exchange Y for a higher price since the prices differed between exchanges. As I built out the application I ran practice scenarios to see my profit margins and boy I tell you they looked great, but there was one problem, transaction speeds. If you have dabbled in crypto currency at all you know that transactions can take a long time to process; with long processing times the profits diminished. I looked to alt coins for faster transactions, but still not quick enough to send funds from one exchange to another and then after fees make a decent profit. Arbit gathered prices and fees from the following exchanges: Gemini, Kraken, Binance, Bittrex, and GDAX.
